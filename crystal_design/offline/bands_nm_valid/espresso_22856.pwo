     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
 
     K-points division:     npool     =       2
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
 
     K-points division:     npool     =       2
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       4
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000049 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =   -3822.99425894 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    1934.54309671 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -223.99540556 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    1287.40984978 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  68 iterations

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     the Fermi energy is     4.2406 ev

!    total energy              =    -746.01340808 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000088 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00056418 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =    -746.01284390 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -344.77805762 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     206.16414364 Ry

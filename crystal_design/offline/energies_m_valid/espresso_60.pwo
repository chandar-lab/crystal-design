NOTICE: Bravais lattice has wrong number (10) of symmetries - symmetries are disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

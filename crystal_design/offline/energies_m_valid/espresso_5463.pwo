     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000080 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00084628 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =    -786.02359664 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -424.66702859 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     238.11061876 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -100.51504685 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -498.95213996 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  19 iterations

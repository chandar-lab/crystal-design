     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Total force =     0.009830     Total SCF correction =     0.003816
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

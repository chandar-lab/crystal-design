     file Al.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF: wavefunction(s)  3S 3P renormalized

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

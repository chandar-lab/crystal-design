     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     one-electron contribution =    -365.97838986 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     215.08591212 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -102.38802688 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -390.76674152 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  19 iterations

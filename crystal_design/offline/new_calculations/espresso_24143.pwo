     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Found identity + (  0.5000 -0.5000 -0.5000) symmetry
     This is a supercell, fractional translations are disabled
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     file In.pbe-dn-rrkjus_psl.0.2.2.UPF: wavefunction(s)  5S renormalized

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

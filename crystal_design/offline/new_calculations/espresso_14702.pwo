     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     the Fermi energy is    13.8085 ev

!    total energy              =   -1191.11239315 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000030 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00074672 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =   -1191.11164644 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -333.24884091 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     225.94342940 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -290.64358543 Ry
     ewald contribution        =    -793.16264950 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations

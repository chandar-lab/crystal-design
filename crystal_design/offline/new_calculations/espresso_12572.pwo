     the Fermi energy is     4.1354 ev

!    total energy              =    -458.84325391 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000028 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =    -458.84325391 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -293.16595325 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     173.14290449 Ry
